"This example contains two suites ``file_formats`` and ``legacy_orc``. The "
"``file_formats`` suite will run queries with names matching the regular "
"expression ``single_.*`` or ``tpch_.*`` in all schemas matching the regular "
"expression ``tpch_sf.*_.*_.*?``. The ``legacy_orc`` suite adds a session "

"The benchmark driver will measure the wall time, total CPU time used by all "
"Presto processes and the CPU time used by the query. For each timing, the "
"driver reports median, mean and standard deviation of the query runs. The "
"difference between process and query CPU times is the query overhead, which "
"is normally from garbage collections. The following is the output from the "
"``file_formats`` suite above:"

"The driver can add additional columns to the output by extracting values "
"from the schema name or SQL files. In the suite file above, the schema names"
" contain named regular expression capturing groups for ``compression``, "
"``format``, and ``scale``, so if we ran the queries in a catalog containing "
"the schemas ``tpch_sf100_orc_none``, ``tpch_sf100_orc_snappy``, and "
"``tpch_sf100_orc_zlib``, we get the above output."
