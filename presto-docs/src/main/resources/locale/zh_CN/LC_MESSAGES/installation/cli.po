"The Presto CLI provides a terminal-based interactive shell for running "
"queries. The CLI is a `self-executing "
"<http://skife.org/java/unix/2011/06/20/really_executable_jars.html>`_ JAR "
"file, which means it acts like a normal UNIX executable."

"By default, the results of queries are paginated using the ``less`` program "
"which is configured with a carefully selected set of options. This behavior "
"can be overridden by setting the environment variable ``PRESTO_PAGER`` to "
"the name of a different program such as ``more``, or set it to an empty "
"value to completely disable pagination."
