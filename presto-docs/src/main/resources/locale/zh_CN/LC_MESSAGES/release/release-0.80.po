msgid "New Hive ORC Reader"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/main/sphinx/release/release-0.80.rst:8
msgid ""
"We have added a new ORC reader implementation. The new reader supports "
"vectorized reads, lazy loading, and predicate push down, all of which make "
"the reader more efficient and typically reduces wall clock time for a query."
" Although the new reader has been heavily tested, it is an extensive rewrite"
" of the Apache Hive ORC reader, and may have some latent issues. If you are "
"seeing issues, you can disable the new reader on a per-query basis by "
"setting the ``<hive-catalog>.optimized_reader_enabled`` session property, or"
" you can disable the reader by default by setting the Hive catalog property "
"``hive.optimized-reader.enabled=false``."
