"This release adds the :doc:`/connector/mysql` and "

"The :doc:`/connector/cassandra` configuration properties ``cassandra.client"
".read-timeout`` and ``cassandra.client.connect-timeout`` are now specified "

"Hive allows the partitions in a table to have a different schema than the "
"table. In particular, it allows changing the type of a column without "
"changing the column type of existing partitions. The Hive connector does not"
" support this and could previously return garbage data for partitions stored"
" using the RCFile Text format if the column type was converted from a non-"
"numeric type such as ``STRING`` to a numeric type such as ``BIGINT`` and the"
" actual data in existing partitions was not numeric. The Hive connector now "
"detects this scenario and fails the query after the partition metadata has "
"been read."
