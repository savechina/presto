"This release changes the Presto ORC reader to favor small buffers when "
"reading varchar and varbinary data. Some ORC files contain columns of data "
"that are hundreds of megabytes when decompressed. In the previous Presto ORC"
" reader, we would allocate a single large shared buffer for all values in "
"the column. This would cause heap fragmentation in CMS and G1, and it would "
"cause OOMs since each value of the column retains a reference to the shared "
"buffer. In this release the ORC reader uses a separate buffer for each value"
" in the column. This reduces heap fragmentation and excessive memory "
"retention at the expense of object creation."
