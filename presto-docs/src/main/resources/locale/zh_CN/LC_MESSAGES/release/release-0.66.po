"In this release we have replaced the existing simple fixed type system with "
"a fully extensible type system and have added several new types. We have "
"also expanded the function system to support custom arithmetic, comparison "
"and cast operators. For example, the new date/time types include an operator"
" for adding an ``INTERVAL`` to a ``TIMESTAMP``."

"Existing functions have been updated to operate on and return the newly "

"Finally, plugins can now provide custom types and operators in addition to "
"connectors and functions. This feature is highly experimental, so expect the"
" interfaces to change over the next few releases.  Also, since in SQL there "
"is only one namespace for types, you should be careful to make names for "
"custom types unique as we will add other common SQL types to Presto in the "
"near future."

"Presto now supports all standard SQL date/time types: ``DATE``, ``TIME``, "
"``TIMESTAMP`` and ``INTERVAL``. All of the date/time functions and language "
"constructs now operate on these types instead of ``BIGINT`` and perform "
"temporal calculations correctly. This was previously broken due to, for "
"example, not being able to detect whether an argument was a ``DATE`` or a "
"``TIMESTAMP``. This change comes at the cost of breaking existing queries "
"that perform arithmetic operations directly on the ``BIGINT`` value returned"
" from the date/time functions."

"This release has full support for time zone rules, which are needed to "
