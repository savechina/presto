"Every TPCH schema provides the same set of tables. Some tables are identical"
" in all schemas. Other tables vary based on the *scale factor* which is "
"determined based on the schema name. For example, the schema ``sf1`` "
"corresponds to scale factor ``1`` and the schema ``sf300`` corresponds to "
"scale factor ``300``. The TPCH connector provides an infinite number of "
"schemas for any scale factor, not just the few common ones listed by ``SHOW "
"SCHEMAS``. The ``tiny`` schema is an alias for scale factor ``0.01``, which "
"is a very small data set useful for testing."
