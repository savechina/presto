"Do not mistake the fact that Presto understands SQL with it providing the "
"features of a standard database. Presto is not a general-purpose relational "
"database. It is not a replacement for databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL or "
"Oracle. Presto was not designed to handle Online Transaction Processing "
"(OLTP). This is also true for many other databases designed and optimized "
"for data warehousing or analytics."

"Presto is a tool designed to efficiently query vast amounts of data using "
"distributed queries. If you work with terabytes or petabytes of data, you "
"are likely using tools that interact with Hadoop and HDFS. Presto was "
"designed as an alternative to tools that query HDFS using pipelines of "
"MapReduce jobs such as Hive or Pig, but Presto is not limited to accessing "
"HDFS. Presto can be and has been extended to operate over different kinds of"
" data sources including traditional relational databases and other data "
"sources such as Cassandra."
