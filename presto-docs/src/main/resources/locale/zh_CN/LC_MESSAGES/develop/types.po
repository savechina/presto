"The ``Type`` interface in Presto is used to implement a type in the SQL "
"language. Presto ships with a number of built-in types, like ``VarcharType``"
" and ``BigintType``. A ``Plugin`` can provide new types by returning them "
"from ``getServices()``. Below is a high level overview of the ``Type`` "
"interface, for more details see the JavaDocs for ``Type``."

"All types define the ``getJavaType()`` method, frequently referred to as the"
" \"native container type\". This is the Java type used to hold values during"
" execution and to store them in a ``Block``. For example, this is the type "
"used in the Java code that implements functions that produce or consume this"
" ``Type``."

"The interpretation of a value in its native container type form is defined "
"by its ``Type``. For some types, such as ``BigintType``, it matches the Java"
" interpretation of the native container type (64bit 2's complement). "
"However, for other types such as ``TimestampWithTimeZoneType``, which also "
"uses ``long`` for its native container type, the value stored in the "
"``long`` is a 8byte binary value combining the timezone and the milliseconds"
" since the unix epoch. In particular, this means that you cannot compare two"
" native values and expect a meaningful result, without knowing the native "
"encoding."

"The signature of a type defines its identity, and also encodes some general "
"information about the type, such as its type parameters (if it's "
"parametric), and its literal parameters. The literal parameters are used in "
"types like ``VARCHAR(10)``."
