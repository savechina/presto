"Window functions perform calculations across rows of the query result. They "
"run after the ``HAVING`` clause but before the ``ORDER BY`` clause. Invoking"
" a window function requires special syntax using the ``OVER`` clause to "
"specify the window. A window has three components:"

"The window frame, which specifies a sliding window of rows to be processed "

"UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW``. This frame contains all rows from the"
