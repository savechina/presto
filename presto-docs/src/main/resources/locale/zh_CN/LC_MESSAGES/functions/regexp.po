"This function is similar to the ``LIKE`` operator, expect that the pattern "
"only needs to be contained within ``string``, rather than needing to match "
"all of ``string``. In other words, this performs a *contains* operation "
"rather than a *match* operation. You can match the entire string by "
"anchoring the pattern using ``^`` and ``$``."

"``${name}`` for a named group. A dollar sign (``$``) may be included in the "
"replacement by escaping it with a backslash (``\\$``)."
